Customer Revenue Bridge (CRB) - Mini Hack
 
Objective
 
The objective of this project is to integrate, process, and analyze customer data to build a Customer Revenue Bridge (CRB) using modern data engineering tools. The focus is on data preparation, transformation, and structured analysis to generate key insights and KPIs.
 
Use Case
 
1. Data Ingestion: Customer data (Excel format) will be shared via Teams and must be ingested into individual local server databases.
 
 
2. Data Loading: Load data from SQL Server to Snowflake using Azure Data Factory (ADF).
 
 
3. Data Processing: Perform data cleansing and transformation using dbt.
 
 
4. Data Analysis: Build a Customer Revenue Bridge (CRB) data cube with key KPIs for evaluation.
 
 
 
Final KPIs
 
Number of churned and new customers over time.
 
Customers with the highest cross-sell and product churn in the given dataset.
 
Net NRR & GRR across all period types.
 
Revenue lost due to contraction over time.
 
New logos identified in each fiscal year (FY).
 
Rank products based on revenue.
 
Rank customers based on revenue.
