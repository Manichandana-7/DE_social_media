Mini Hack â€“ Turning Raw Data into Decisions

Objective:
Each individual will work on integrating, processing, and analyzing customer data to build a Customer Revenue Bridge (CRB) using modern data engineering tools. The focus will be on data preparation, transformation, and structured analysis.


Use Case:

1.Data Ingestion: Customer data (Excel format) will be shared via Teams and must be ingested into individual local server databases.
2.Data Loading: Load data from SQL Server to Snowflake using Azure Data Factory (ADF).
3.Data Processing: Perform data cleansing and transformation using dbt.
4.Data Analysis: Build a Customer Revenue Bridge (CRB) data cube with key KPIs for evaluation.

 
Final KPIs:

1.Number of churned and new customers over time.
2.Customers with the highest cross-sell and product churn in the given dataset.
3.Net NRR & GRR across all period types.
4.Revenue lost due to contraction over time.
5.New logos identified in each fiscal year (FY).
6.Rank products based on revenue.
7.Rank customers based on revenue.
